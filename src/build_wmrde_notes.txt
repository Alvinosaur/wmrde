Building the Ogre sdk
on Linux Mint 17.3

*when building ogre dependencies with cmake
where is source:
/home/neal/Ogre/source/Dependencies/ogredeps
(not /home/neal/Ogre/source/Dependencies)

*after sudo make install, /usr/local/lib/libOIS.so does not exist. it only exists in ~/Ogre/build/Dependencies/ogredeps/lib
in cmake-gui, needed to change:
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX from /home/neal/Ogre/build/Dependencies/ogredeps
to /usr/local

*when trying to build ogre with cmake-gui, click Configure
package 'OIS' not found
Found OIS: optimized;/usr/local/lib/libOIS.so;debug;/usr/local/lib/libOIS.so

set OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR to /home/neal/Ogre/source/ogre/Dependencies/ogredeps, is this necessary?


*CMake Error:
  -- The following REQUIRED packages could NOT be located on your system.
  + Xaw: X11 Athena widget set <http://www.x.org>

sudo apt-get install xorg-dev, fixed it


instead of /home/neal use ~/ in README?


Building wmrde
*CMake Error:
Could not find a package configuration file profided by "Eigen" with any of 
EigenConfig.cmake
eigen-config.cmake

had to change:
find_package(Eigen REQUIRED)
to: find_package(Eigen3 REQUIRED)


*fixed a warning, make arguments the same:
if(EXISTS "/usr/local/lib/OGRE/cmake")
endif(EXISTS "/usr/local/lib/OGRE/cmake")


*make error:
from /home/neal/Projects/wmrde/src/main.cpp:2:
/home/neal/Projects/wmrde/src/../include/wmrde/ode/WmrModelODE.h:10:21: fatal error: ode/ode.h: No such file or directory
 #include <ode/ode.h>

eliminate the dependency on ode for now,
eliminate HDRS
don't use GLOB_RECURSE for SRCS,
instead list each explicitly:
SET(SRCS
# ode/ comment out for now!
)


*error when running ./OgreApp
  what():  OGRE EXCEPTION(7:InternalErrorException): Could not load dynamic library /usr/local/lib/OGRE/Plugin_CgProgramManager.  System Error: /usr/local/lib/OGRE/Plugin_CgProgramManager.so.1.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory in DynLib::load at /home/neal/Ogre/source/ogre/OgreMain/src/OgreDynLib.cpp (line 109)


retry cmake-gui for Ogre source
Looking for Cg...
checking for module 'Cg'
  package 'Cg' not found
Could not locate Cg

$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-cg-toolkit
fixed the problem

in wmrde/build/dist/bin/plugins.cfg, comment out the plugin
# Plugin=Plugin_CgProgramManager
